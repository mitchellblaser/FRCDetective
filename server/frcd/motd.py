firstrun01 = '''Welcome to the FRC Detective!
We've detected this is the first time you're
running the server application.
Before we get started, there's a couple of
things we need to go over...
'''

firstrun02 = '''First, we'll need to set up an administrator
username and password.'''

firstrun03 = '''Thanks. You can add additional users
from the management interface later.
'''

firstrun04 = '''Now we just need to generate a couple
of extra files for you...
'''

firstrun05 = '''Done. You can now connect clients to the
server. Ensure you make a new user for every person
on the team who will be scouting.

You can do this by navigating to:
http://localhost:8080/ and logging in with the 
username and password you just created.

We'll let you get to scouting now, and thanks for
trying out the FRC Detective!
