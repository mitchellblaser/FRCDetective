## Installation Instructions

#### Server
To install a prebuilt release of the FRC Detective Server application, which has been tested and verified to work, download it from our website, and upload it to your server/computer.

For the Server to work, you'll need to have the Docker engine installed on your system. If you don't already have it, read the instructions <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">here.</a> For Linux systems, you'll want the Docker Engine, and Windows/Mac users will need to get the entire Docker Desktop application.

Once downloaded, grab a copy of the latest Server Release from our <a href="/download">Download Page</a>.
